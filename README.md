# Weather_Linear_Regression
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on a weather dataset. After the EDA, Linear Regression Models were built to predict the target variable. 
Three Linear Regression Techniques are used for the dataset: Simple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
The performance of the three linear regression techniques performance were compared using the R&sup2; and mse scores. 
The target variable: Temperature (°C) 
The features: Location, Temperature (°C), Feels Like (°C), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (kph), Cloud Cover (%), Pressure (mb), UV Index, and Visibility (km).
